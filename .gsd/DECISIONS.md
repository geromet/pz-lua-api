| # | When | Scope | Decision | Choice | Rationale | Revisable? |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | 2026-03 | Navigation | History suppression during state restore | `_restoringState` flag in `state.js` | Single flag, no param threading, zero cognitive overhead for new nav actions | No |
| 2 | 2026-03 | Data model | Inheritance gaps | `_extends_map` separate from `all_classes` | Keeps class list clean — only real API classes; gap-filling is a separate lookup | No |
| 3 | 2026-03 | Data model | Interface extends | `_interface_extends` separate from `_extends_map` | 1:many vs 1:1 data shape; different traversal semantics | No |
| 4 | 2026-03 | UI | Implements display | Grouped by class in chain, not flat | Flat list of 20+ items is unusable; grouping shows provenance | Low |
| 5 | 2026-03 | Legal | Pre-shipped Java sources | Ship in `sources/` (~3889 files) | Indie Stone ToS 2.1 permits distributing base game files for non-commercial PZ promotion | No |
| 6 | 2026-03 | Git | Branch discipline | Never push to `main` | `main` auto-deploys to GitHub Pages | No |
| 7 | 2026-03-13 | GSD setup | GSD root | `.gsd/` at `projectzomboid/` (CWD), not inside `pz-lua-api-viewer/` | GSD resolves `.gsd/` relative to CWD; CWD is `projectzomboid/`; placing it here lets auto-mode work without `cd` | Low |
| 8 | 2026-03-13 | GSD setup | Shared docs | `pz-lua-api-viewer/docs/` remains the shared doc system; GSD roadmap/slices/tasks live in `.gsd/milestones/` | Claude Code and GSD both need `docs/`; GSD planning artifacts are separate from shared operational docs | No |
| 9 | 2026-03-13 | M001 structure | Task granularity | Each former TASK-NNN becomes one GSD task within a slice | Existing task files have enough detail; slice wraps related tasks into a demoable unit | Low |
