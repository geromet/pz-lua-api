# T04: Write real S03 summary and commit

**Slice:** S03 — Version Selector
**Milestone:** M001

## Description

Replace the doctor-created placeholder S03-SUMMARY.md and S03-UAT.md with real artifacts that compress the full S03 story (T01 extractor versioned output, T02 frontend dropdown, T03 automated tests and diagnostic surface). Commit and push to liability-machine.

## Steps

1. Read the existing task summaries in `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/tasks/` (T01-SUMMARY.md, T02-SUMMARY.md, and the T03 output) to gather what happened across all three implementation tasks.
2. Write `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-SUMMARY.md` as a real compressed summary with proper YAML frontmatter. Include:
   - **What was built**: extractor version detection (`detect_pz_version()`, SVNRevision.txt), versioned JSON output (`versions/lua_api_r964.json`, `versions/versions.json`), frontend dropdown (`#version-select` in toolbar), `?v=<id>` URL param handling, full-page-reload version switching, `data-version-active` diagnostic attribute, Playwright test suite.
   - **Key decisions**: full page reload for version switch (avoids complex state reset); dropdown hidden for ≤1 version; unknown `?v=` falls back to first manifest entry; route-intercept pattern for version tests.
   - **Forward intelligence**: `versions/versions.json` is the manifest contract (list of `{id, label, file}`); `data-version-active` on `#version-select` is the runtime inspection surface; route-intercept pattern from P003 applies to version tests too; version switching uses full reload so no in-memory state cleanup needed.
3. Write `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-UAT.md` with real smoke-test cases: (a) load app → dropdown hidden with single version, (b) load with ≥2 manifest entries → dropdown visible, (c) `?v=r964` in URL → correct version selected, (d) delete/rename versions.json → app boots normally in single-file mode.
4. Commit all S03 changes (plan, task plans, summary, UAT, test file, app.js change) and push to `liability-machine`.

## Must-Haves

- [ ] S03-SUMMARY.md is a real summary (not placeholder) with proper YAML frontmatter
- [ ] S03-UAT.md has concrete smoke-test cases
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to liability-machine

## Verification

- `! grep -q 'placeholder' .gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-SUMMARY.md` — no placeholder text
- `git status` clean after push

## Inputs

- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/tasks/T01-SUMMARY.md` — extractor task summary
- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/tasks/T02-SUMMARY.md` — frontend task summary
- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-SUMMARY.md` — current placeholder to replace
- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-UAT.md` — current placeholder to replace
- `.gsd/test/s03_version_selector.py` — test file from T03 to reference in summary

## Expected Output

- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-SUMMARY.md` — real compressed summary replacing placeholder
- `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S03/S03-UAT.md` — real UAT checklist replacing placeholder
